            To resize the image on PIXLR you have to open up the Pixlr editor, create or use an image from your computer, url or library. In the top left hand corner click Image next to Edit and Layer and then click on the first dropdown option which will be Image Size. Change the width of the picture and the height will adjust so the image keeps its shape and click ok. To save it you click File in the top left hand corner and then Save and then name your file and choose the image type (JPEG, PNG eg...)
                                                                                                                 </div5>

             To crop an image in PIXLR you have to open up the Pixlr editor, use an image from you computer, url or library. On the verticle bar on the left hand side of the screen there will be a crop tool in the top left of that bar above the square and left of the arrow. To use this tool, click on it and then click on your image, hold the mouse and move the mouse so a box appears accordingly to how much of the image you would like to keep. Once you have done this you press enter or double click and the rest of the image outside the box will disappear.
